# 11.30

卷发尝试用cube拆分，但是效果很差。不如曲线+雕刻。

I tried using a cube to split the curls, but the effect was poor. It's better to use curves and sculpting.

just tried to imitate Chen Qianyu's hairstyle, but the result wasn't as ultimately comfortable as Arknights: Endfield.

Some hair should be carved out with strips. I’ll practice drawing it properly in the next few water classes.
